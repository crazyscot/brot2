A GTK-based interactive Mandelbrot set explorer.

Mouse click operations (currently hard-wired):
	Button 1 (left): Zoom in (around the clicked point)
	Button 2 (middle): Recentre
	Button 3 (right): Zoom out (around the clicked point)
	Button 8 (4th button on my Kensington Expert Mouse): Drag out a rectangle
	         to zoom into. What you get won't quite match, as the aspect
			 ratio autofix kicks in to ensure you get square pixels.

`Undo' is only single-step, designed to let you recover from the "oh dear
I accidentally dragged out a silly rectangle, where was I?" scenario.


Building
--------

You will need libgtk2.0-dev and libpng12-dev.
One day I may build it into a Debian package.


What's in a name? 
-----------------

This is my second Mandelbrotter.

The first was cryptically named 'brot'; both the origins of its name, and
the code, are lost in the mists of time circa 2001. It was a bit pants,
even by the standards of the time; it took its parameters on the command
line and output as a TIFF, ASCII art or to a terminal which understood
ANSI graphics codes. (I claim this as a dubiously legitimate reason for
setting xterm to 'unreadable' :-) )

This one is a bit better featured, but to me it's logically the heir to its
now-departed ancestor, hence the name.
