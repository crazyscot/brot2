brot2 (1.1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fix automake machinery so that make dist works again. (Oops!)
  * LP#882411: Create unit test framework.
  * Major rewrite of the fractal plotting machinery, with reasonable unit
  test support (closes #882411).  'make check' added.  Updated CLI and gtkui
  to use new machinery.  Removed old Render and Plot2 as obsolete.
  * LP#1039385: Major HUD improvements: text reduced; font size is now
  variable (and a preference); can appear with an outline text effect;
  can show/hide 'Zoom:' legend; uses reasonable superscript notation.
  * LP#1033910: Report in the HUD when we're at the zoom limit, and don't
  bother to zoom further.
  * LP#1099061: Avoid creating/destroying one thread per plot.
