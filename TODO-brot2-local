 - UI rework for something more gmap-like tile-based. Drag viewport around during render, render only those tiles which are visible; zoom uses blown-up tiles first; tile data cached on an LRU basis.
 - Deprecation warnings from libav - needs rework


WISHLIST:
 - Add a note to the UI that keyframes can be reordered by dragging them
 - ease in/out of holds?
   (( MovieRender / MovieMotion.cpp
	  What to do? Ramp speed up/down, that's what...
	  MovieRender keeps "current" speed, which we ramp.
	  *** Robert Penner's easing functions ***
	  For ease in: How far from end do we start ramping down...? We know when the end is coming, so we can decide on a frame number N to start ramping down from.
	  Maybe speed becomes a float?
	  What size/profile the ramp up/down? Maybe 10 frames? 20? 30?? Is it linear ramp or more complex? (What does AE do?)

 - Port to OSX and get going on moonstone... at least the CLI... for parallel :)
 - Amazon EC2 for a really big render? Price it out. Maybe as part of a parallel run.
 - Windows port & ability to ssh/parallel to it. Need a network packet format (hello protobuf...)

LATER:
 - revisit palette, can I do better with mine? rjk's is particularly pretty. Analyse the raw numbers with brot2cli --csv mode.
 - prefs such as initial maxiter, are these being passed on to all movie renders? What about cli/remote? Hahaha.
- Test HUD in PNG & with valgrind.
- IWBNI we would show the duration of each segment, so we can see which is blowing up.
* Run helgrind and/or DRD some time, look for thread issues. Note that helgrind recommends using semaphores in preference to condvars...
- Consider 50 as a speed clamp. Seems to be OK from limited testing.
- Show a non-keyframe in main window?? (Build/show a list of keyframes...)

MAYBE SOME TIME:
- Maybe some time.. Animate maxiter as keyframeable?
- IWBNI we could tweak the prefs (specifically re the HUD position etc) for the render, as opposed to inheriting master.
